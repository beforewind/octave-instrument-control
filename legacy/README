IMPORTANT NOTE:

error handling is not implemented yet. if you do something wrong octave
will hang or crash

the toolbox was written to make simple test automation. it is far away
from being mature.

----------

before you start you need to compile all toolboxes
see README file at the directories

----------

gpib_tb/       Talks to instruments over GPIB interface using open
               source linux-gpib. Tested with NI_GPIB_USB_B Interface,
               but should work with all GPIB adapters supported by
               linux-gpib.
               (linux)

gpibenet_tb/   Talks to instruments over GPIB using NIs GPIBENET-100,
               using tcp functions from 'tcp_tb'
               note: still very incomplete
               (cygwin, linux)

ser_tb/        Communicate over serial port
               (cygwin, linux)

tcp_tb/        Comunicate over TCP
               note: disconnects from remote side are not handled
               (cygwin, linux)             

usbtmc_tb/     Talks to instruments over USBTMC using the USBTMC
               interface of actual linux kernel.
               (linux)

visa_tb/       Talks to all interfaces that are supported by VISA.
               Someone started an openvisa implementation for linux,
               but it is not functional. However, you are able to build
               visa_tb by linking to openvisa.
               note: Linking to National Instruments VISA is most
               probably a violation of GPL.

vxi11_tb/      Talks to instruments over VXI-11 interface.
               note: On cygwin you should not open/close a VXI11 session
               to same instrument serveral times. Seems that libtirpc
               doesn't close the sessions completely.
               (cygwin, linux)

examples/      some functions that use toolbox to communicate

inittb.m       init toolboxes

----------

start octave in this directory and type "inittb"
