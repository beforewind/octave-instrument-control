Summary of important user-visible changes for octave-instrument-control 0.0.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Initial release

 ** Support for TCP interface I/O

 ** Support for USBTMC interface I/O

 ** The following functions are new:
        tcp
        tcp_read
        tcp_write
        tcp_timeout
        tcp_close
        usbtmc
        usbtmc_read
        usbtmc_write
        usbtmc_close

 ** octave-instrument-control is intended as test release and
    playground for new low level I/O functions. If stable enough, the
    functions will be included to octave-forge's instrument-control,
    hopefully.
